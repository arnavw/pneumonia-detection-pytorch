# Detection and Localization of Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Scans

This project uses a resnet-152 model to detect pneumonia in chest x-ray scans. In addition, it draws a heatmap to indicate the areas of the image that the network has classified as containing pneumonia.

The dataset used for this project can be retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.
